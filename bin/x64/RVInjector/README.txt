----- RVInjector Welcome Message -----

Thank you for downloading RVInjector.
To ensure optimal performance, I recommend placing both the executable and the DLL in your local Rumbleverse directory. While not mandatory, this practice helps prevent potential issues related to the program locating the DLL.

!!! IMPORTANT NOTICE !!!
DO NOT SEPARATE THE EXE AND THE DLL; ENSURE THEY RESIDE IN THE SAME DIRECTORY.
RVInjector relies on the presence of 'rumbleverse.dll' in the executable (RVInjetor's) directory.

If you encounter any issues or have questions, feel free to contact me on discord: nu11k3y

Disclaimer: Currently, RVInjector is optimized for the regular non-network test version of Rumbleverse. An issue has been identified with the NT version, and efforts are ongoing to resolve it. The error you may encounter is an EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION reading address 0xffffffffffffffff, but this may also be due to the fact i modified my dllmain slightly in the VCXPROJ file for the SDK

For convenience, here is the error log:

here is the error: Unhandled Exception: EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION reading address 0xffffffffffffffff

ntdll

i also got another error specifically mentioning an area around line 1560ish in the DLL itself. but its occasional. not sure whats causing it but ill look into it and see if it has anything to do with this injector specifically. or if it is specifically the DLL causing an issue. 


hope you enjoy! Happy Modding! -N0vaW01f
